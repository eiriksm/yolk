# Yolk

A library for building asynchronous user interfaces.

![travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/BrewhouseTeam/yolk.svg)

* __Familiar__: Yolk is a small library (11kb minified + gzipped) built on top of [Virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). It exposes a very limited API so that you don't have to spend weeks getting up to speed. Yolk components are just plain functions that return JSX.

* __Everything is an observable__: Yolk components consume RxJS observable streams as if they were plain values. From a websocket connection to a generator function to an event handler. If it can be represented as an observable, then can be rendered directly into your markup.

* __Stateless__: Being able to describe user interactions, control flow and plain values as observable streams means that application design becomes entirely declarative. There is no need to manually subscribe to observables in order to mutate or set component state.

## Example

The following example renders a component with buttons to increment and decrement a counter.

```js
import Yolk from `yolk`

function Counter () {

  // map all plus button click events to 1
  const handlePlus = this.createEventHandler()
  const plusOne = handlePlus.map(() => 1)

  // map all minus button click events to -1
  const handleMinus = this.createEventHandler()
  const minusOne = handleMinus.map(() => -1)

  // merge both event streams together and keep a running count of the result
  const count = plusOne.merge(minusOne).scan((x, y) => x + y, 0).startWith(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button id="plus" onClick={handlePlus}>+</button>
        <button id="minus" onClick={handleMinus}>-</button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span>Count: {count}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

Yolk.render(<Counter />, document.getElementById('container'))
```

## API

The Yolk API is intentionally very limited so that you don't have to spend weeks getting up to speed. With an understanding of [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS), you can begin building with Yolk immediately.

__`createEventHandler(mapping: any, initialValue: any): Function`__

Creates a special function that can also be used as an observable. If the function is called, the input value is pushed to the observable as it's latest value. In other words, when this function is used as an event handler, the result is an observable stream of events from that handler. For example:

```js
// create an event handler
const handleClick = Yolk.createEventHandler()

// use event handler to count the number of clicks
const numberOfClicks =
  handleClick.scan((acc, ev) => acc + 1, 0).startWith(0)

// create an element that displays the number of clicks
// and a button to increment it
const component = (
  <div>
    <span>Number of clicks: {numberOfClicks}</span>
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
  </div>
)
```

When custom components are destroyed, we want to make sure that all of our event handlers are properly cleaned up.
That's why, instead of using `Yolk.createEventHandler()`, users should prefer `this.createEventHandler()`. Creating
an event handler as part of a component instance will ensure that everything is automatically cleaned up for you.
For example,

```js
function CustomComponent (props, children) {
  const handleClick = this.createEventHandler()

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>
  )
}
```

__`render(instance: YolkComponent, node: HTMLElement): YolkComponent`__

Renders an instance of a YolkComponent inside of an HTMLElement.

```js
Yolk.render(<span>Hello World!</span>, document.getElementById('container'))
```

__`createElement(component: Function | string, props: Object, ...children: Array<any>): YolkComponent`__

Creates a new instance of a YolkComponent from a function or string.  To make this less verbose, you should write JSX instead (see below).

## Using JSX

It is highly suggested that you write Yolk with JSX. This is achieved using the [Babel transpiler](http://babeljs.io/). You should configure the `jsxPragma` option for Babel either in `.babelrc` or in `package.json`:

`.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "jsxPragma": "Yolk.createElement"
}
```

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "babel": {
    "jsxPragma": "Yolk.createElement"
  }
}
```

Then anywhere you use jsx it will be transformed into plain JavaScript. For example, this:

```js
<p>My JSX</p>
```

Turns into:

```js
Yolk.createElement(
  "p",
  null,
  "Hello"
);
```

Without this pragma, Babel will assume that you mean to write JSX for React and you will receive `React is undefined` errors.

## Supported Events

Yolk supports the following list of standard browser events:

```
onAbort onBlur onCanPlay onCanPlayThrough onChange onClick onContextMenu onCopy
onCueChange onCut onDblClick onDrag onDragEnd onDragEnter onDragLeave onDragOver
onDragStart onDrop onDurationChange onEmptied onEnded onError onFocus onInput
onInvalid onKeyDown onKeyPress onKeyUp onLoadedData onLoadedMetaData onLoadStart
onMouseDown onMouseMove onMouseOut onMouseOver onMouseUp onPaste onPause onPlay
onPlaying onProgress onRateChange onReset onScroll onSearch onSeeked onSeeking
onSelect onShow onStalled onSubmit onSuspend onTimeUpdate onToggle onVolumeChange
onWaiting onWheel
```

In addition, Yolk supports the following custom browser events:

```
onMount onUnmount
```

## Supported Attributes

Yolk supports the following list of standard element attributes:

```
accept acceptCharset accessKey action align alt async autoComplete autoFocus autoPlay
autoSave bgColor border buffered cite className code codebase color colSpan content
contentEditable coords default defer dir dirName download draggable dropZone email
encType file for headers height hidden high href hrefLang httpEquiv icon id isMap

formAction formEncType formMethod formTarget frameBorder inputMode is list manifest
maxLength media minLength role rows seamless size sizes srcSet width wmode checked
controls loop multiple readOnly selected srcDoc value
```

## Setup

To install Yolk, simply include it in your `package.json` along with your preferred version of `rx`,

```
npm install yolk rx --save
```

Or instead with Bower,

```
bower install yolk rx --save
```

[RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) is listed as a dependency of this library; however, it is not included as part of the bundled file. You must include your own version of `rx`.
